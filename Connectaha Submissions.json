        "description": "In the software industry, it’s common to be on a project with an aggressive timeline.  Even if the schedule was correct, plans don't always go the way you expect and become off track. Teams end up working more extended hours, try to add people to the project or make other heroic efforts to try and “save the day’ and finish on time.  In my experience, rarely have those efforts worked and when it did, the team was so burned out it took several weeks to get motivated to tackle another project.\r\n\r\nThere should be a better way to complete projects on time, so teams feel a sense of accomplishment and are excited to take on the next project. In this session, we discuss three key behaviors you can do with your team, unlocking a better way to work to help the team succeed.\r\n",

        "abstract": "How are you supposed to sing along with your favorite TV theme song every week if it doesn't have lyrics? At my house, we \"meow\" along (loudly). We also code, so I built 'Meowifier' to convert any song into a cat's meows. Join me in this exploration of melody analysis APIs and gratuitous cat gifs.",
        "description": "I built an application that takes a song's audio and outputs a new audio file with that song's melody **sung by cats**. It's a technical feat. It's hilarious. It's beautiful. It's a new way to waste time on the internet.\r\n\r\nThis talk walks through how _Meowifier_ was built, focusing on three aspects of the build that you might be surprised to learn were unique challenges.\r\n\r\n**1. Finding a way to obtain the notes of  _only_ the melody from a song's audio file**\r\nNo bass line or harmony muddying things, please. The melody is the principal part of a song. If you were listening to 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by _Queen_, the melody would be the part Freddy Mercury is singing. If you were to include the harmonies and bass parts in the meow-ified version, you wouldn't even recognize the resulting song because it would all sound jumbled together. Finding an API for song analysis and melody-extraction was surprisingly difficult. \r\n\r\n**2. Correcting your meow length to match the length of the note in the melody**\r\nA melody is going to have notes of varying lengths. When you think back to 'Bohemian Rhapsody', Freddy doesn't hold each note for 0.5 seconds each. Some of them are .25 seconds or 0.125 seconds or even 1.5 seconds. But I can't have a meow folder containing meow files of every conceivable length. That would be a bloated monster of a library. Instead, I had to find a tool that could either cut or extend a meow to fill the proper amount of time.\r\n\r\n**3. Creating a multi-octave library of meows**\r\nThat's a lot of meows, and if you hadn't noticed, very few cats meow in the tenor, baritone, or bass ranges. And where does one hire a cat choir to begin with? So I had to make my own custom meow library using some interesting tactics. (If you're imagining me meowing into a microphone with a tuner in hand, for each imaginable meow note, you're not far off!)\r\n\r\nConferences are great, but there's only so much information you can digest at a time. At my talk, you'll get a light-hearted break where you can laugh a bit and learn a bit. And maybe you'll get the motivation you need to move forward with your own frivolous side project idea. Also, pictures of my cats.",

The structure TypeScript imposes provides a declarative syntax that gives semantic meaning to the streams we use to build application state. Cut through the boilerplate using NgRx.",
        "description": "We’ve heard that using TypeScript can help us avoid painful bugs programmers commonly run into when writing JavaScript by type-checking our code. One of purposes of TypeScript is to “statically identify constructs that are likely to be errors”. With NgRx we can take advantage of this type safety by using TypeScript classes as action creators with readonly type properties, so we can then infer the action object types in our state management code.\r\n\r\nNgRx provides a structuring mechanism for larger applications; it's a design pattern teaches you how to think. In this pattern, the developer needs to identify the streams of values the application is interested in and how they are combined to produce meaningful information for the view layer. The streams, the various applications states, and the view layer models are what we are setting out to define when we use Redux-style state management. This talk will show how to use the various NgRx reactive libraries for Angular state management to build out our application streams and then consume them in our components and services.\r\n",

        "description": "Front-end development can be complicated. There are enough libraries and enough churn to make anyone feel lost in the shuffle. Common concerns for any modern web application include features like authentication, user content, APIs, and analytics. In this session, you will get a break-down and demo of the key features of AWS Amplify, an open-source toolchain from Amazon. Amplify abstracts away the common functionality that so many applications share and allows developers to focus on building – not plumbing! This session will walk through a simple application high-lighting the features and tools the library provides. This should leave you with the knowledge of \"how and why\" you would integrate this with your own projects. The session will use React to demonstrate the features of the library, but general front-end development experience is all that is required.",

Durable Functions will be orchestrating the whole logic. We shouldn't forget about Service Bus Queues/Topics, but we'll also need Event Grid to connect various parts of the system.

Building complex workflows with them mean that you'll usually use a whole bunch of queues, and place logic that determines what's the next step inside of each function (where it shouldn't be), instead of in a central place.\r\nNow enter Durable Task Framework and its Azure „implementation“ Azure Durable Functions.\r\nThey come with event-sourcing available out-of-the-box, meaning that all of a sudden your functions can remember state. Developing complex workflow is no different that awaiting for some Tasks in your „console C# app“, and chaining and error handling is built in.\r\nSo all of a sudden your serverless system start having simple, and clean code while being resilient.\r\nNot only that, but you'll be able to call some non-functions services, place your function to sleep (which doesn't incur costs), and wake out once the external event URL has been triggered.\r\nEnough said, let's build some live demos during this session 😉",

        "description": "Data as it appears in the real world is naturally connected, but traditional data modeling focuses on entities which can cause for complicated joins of these naturally connected data.  That is where graph databases come in as they store data more like what happens naturally in the real world.  Sure, there a lot of talk about using graph databases for social networks, recommendation engines, and Internet of Things; but using graph databases can also make a lot of sense when working with common business data problems.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will get a better understanding of what graph databases are, how to use the Gremlin API within Azure Cosmos DB to traverse such data structures, and see practical examples to common data problems.",

        "description": "My daughter was diagnosed with a rare disease in late 2015. She started chemotherapy in February of 2016 and we are still riding that train. It has been a whirlwind of emotions and support, or lack thereof. As we got further along in the treatments, the parallels between patient support and working with clients became clearer. The key takeaway - deliver what the client needs, not what they ask for. But how do you do that? And how does this relate to chemotherapy again? This is for more than just developers or consultants - everyone can walk away with something new.",
        "notes": "My daughter, now 5, has actually finished chemotherapy, but the rest of this is a true story. I did learn many lessons from support groups on how to better support my clients. These lessons can be transferred to projects whether or not the attendee is a developer or a consultant or devops, whether they work on client contracts or on a single product. Empathy is a hard topic to talk about, let alone grok and practice, but I hope I have a unique angle to illuminate the importance of empathy. I am a white male, not a person of color or a woman, so I can't speak much on diversity from that angle, other than to say we need to listen to what they have to say. I strongly suggest you pick a POC or woman over me for a diversity/empathy talk, but if you need a different perspective on it, I may be able to provide that.",

However enterprise demands often cause Spring Boot projects to become bloated, out of date, and have inconsistent implementations, leading to them being difficult to maintain both for the teams responsible for a project and from an enterprise level of ensuring projects properly implement features like security, logging, database connectivity, and other common concerns.  \r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will look at some of the underlying philosophies of Spring Boot and see at how to apply them to the enterprise. Specific topics include creating customs starter libraries, BOMs, and easing project initialization steps all with the goal of reducing developer toil and frustration while ensuring consistent behavior across large enterprises but not blocking experimentation. If your organization has been struggling with bloated poms, projects full of dead code, and long pipelines from project conception to deployment to production this is a presentation you will definitely want to check out.  \r\n\r\n",

Except native default browser styling of the :focus pseudo class is rather blah, don't you think? There has to be a better way to add some pizzazz to elements when users navigate without a mouse. In this talk, I will demo numerous ways to provide custom focus styles despite known limitations in the web platform.

        "description": "Farm Credit Services of America has a different take on what an Internship experience should be. We took the idea of an Internship, and made it AWESOME! The Intern Program is team based, and allows a small group of software development students to work together on a team along with four or five full-time mentors and leaders to create a greenfield enterprise application. The experience allows the students to iterate through the full software development life cycle in an enterprise environment: from sketching out wire-frames to deploying an enterprise application in Production. \r\n\r\nWe will also talk through how we do our intern interviews differently. Our interviews do not consist of the traditional sit-down interview with questions. We have a fun and relaxed process that let's the candidates express their creativity, collaboration, problem solving, and their personality. This helps to insure that we are investing in people that fit our culture.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest benefits to our approach is that the students get an experience of what life is like in the real world. The amount of learning that happens when you apply the theory that's been learned in school across the entirety of the software development life-cycle in highly-collaborative enterprise team environment is indescribable. ",
        "notes": "We are the best people to talk on this subject, because we don't think there's another company around that has an Intern Program designed in this way. The feedback we get from the interns that have experienced our internship, and other internships at well-known technology companies is that ours is second to none. We continue to attract top talent, and our recruitment base grows year-after-year by word-of-mouth from the students. We've also hired many of our interns into full-time positions after they graduate.",

We consider ourselves to have a strong and thriving remote culture. We have tried many things over the past 4 years, and I'll be sharing what worked and what didn't. For our company and many others, remote employees are essential to growing the company due to a limited talent pool in one area. The challenges involved with engaging and retaining those employees can be a big hindrance to that growth. The goal of this talk is to help other companies that may be testing the waters or struggling with remote employees and distributed teams.\r\n\r\nSome of these strategies are around holding meetings in a way that don't leave remote people at a disadvantage, keeping _all_ team communication in a medium that includes remote people, and scheduling explicit pair programming time with remote people. Everyone gets a webcam and a quality headset, and we focus on making sure there's plenty of bandwidth for everyone to be on video chats. We've removed as much friction as possible to keep our employees engaged with each other despite being a thousand miles away.",
        "notes": "While I am not a remote employee, I have been on and involved with distributed teams with remote employees for years. I was there when we first started experimenting with ways to maintain efficiency with distributed teams as well as ways to keep remote employees engaged with the company. When on distributed teams, I've been a driver in changing our processes to make a better experience for remote workers. Employee engagement and retention has always been a passion of mine, so I've paid close attention to what has worked, what hasn't, and why.",

Some of the possible causes were: longer times at war, brain/head trauma, and seeing other soldiers around them killed. In another study, it was showcased that the rate of suicides in India has risen by 23% from 2000 to 2015, and suicides by young adults is a growing concern in the country. The array of causes includes financial instability, dowry, loan repayment, and caste-related violence.</p>\r\n<p>Depression is one of the leading causes of suicides, and more than 300 million people of all ages worldwide suffer from it. Also, with each passing day, addiction kills 29 people in the United States, due to drunk driving accidents, resulting in the annual cost of alcohol-related crashes to be more than USD 44 billion.

This is where another one of our core values comes in - we believe that design matters.\r\n\r\nWith such a wide audience, Flywheel's key business reports need to be well designed and engaging so that they can effectively build empathy and ownership across the company on many levels. By adding design as the last step of our data workflow, we ensure that the data everyone sees is unified and familiar; whimsical yet authoritative.\r\n\r\nI'll talk about Flywheel's journey making these delightful dashboards as well as demo some useful techniques on how you too can effectively implement design elements into your reporting.

Conversations start immediately when a stakeholder has an idea, and continue all the way through pairing on writing code--and finalize after the feature is in use.",

When do you discuss things like test case construction? Test data creation? Performance needs? And let's just skip by security because that's scary.\r\n\r\nIn this session we'll walk through creating a critical business feature. We'll take the journey all the way from ideation through production monitoring. You'll learn where to have various conversations about quality, and what you might consider along the way.\r\n\r\nYou'll see examples of good conversations used to help business focus on high-value features. You'll also help build out solid acceptance criteria, and you'll learn where to tie those pesky \"Non-functional requirements\" in. We'll tie all this together with working tests and code--and you'll see how exploratory testing fits in along the entire journey.\r\n\r\nMake sure you're getting the best quality coverage of your work!",

        "description": "Fear not... whatever you can do by using Infrastructure as Code can be done by hand through a GUI, given enough time... but there are probably better things to spend time on.\r\nThere is plenty Infrastructure as Code solutions out there, but there's a relatively „new kid on the block“ that plays extremely well with serverless and allows you to perform wonders in minutes/hours rather than days. Please welcome Pulumi.\r\nServerless stuff is charged per usage so there's no penalty if you've deployed five function apps instead of just one. The reason why we need five or fifty or five hundred of them are the limits on how fast, and how big can your function app scale.\r\nPulumi will take care of that, but we also need to deploy some software to those functions / containers / PaaS / etc. Not only that, but before deploying we need to fetch connection strings for DBs / storage / cache that we've just provisioned, and that's where the fun start. Trust me, you don't want to set up a release definition for five hundred function apps by hand, especially if they're scattered across multiple clouds.\r\nThat's where the fun starts and where you start connecting Pulumi with some scripts that handle you CI/CD. My tool of preference is Azure DevOps, and you're welcome to join this half demo half mumbling talk.",

[Blazor](http://blazor.net) is one that's taken the .NET developer community by storm. There is a lot of intro content on how to get started or what you can do with Blazor, but not a lot that speaks to how to solve problems you may come up against with Blazor. In this session, we're going to talk about some of the highs and lows of WebAssembly, Blazor & Razor Components, and explore potential solutions to standing up a real world application built with Blazor with Javascript, and C#",

I've lived through the highs and lows and have become passionate about finding ways to share what I continue to learn but also to help other developers along their journey. It's for this reason I became a developer evangelist with a great company, Twilio, that continues to find ways to inspire and equip developers amongst their respective language communities. It's that same passion that drove me down the road of Blazor - so much so that I'm creating a new video stream in January dedicated to this same topic. I'm excited to possibly share what I know with the community at Connectaha",

And why is it important anyway?”\r\n\r\nThis highly interactive talk will present the findings and guide and challenge you through a journey to understanding safety. Including short interactive sessions and role play exercises to cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n* What is safety?\r\n* What is a team?\r\n* What is the definition of an effective or high performance team?\r\n* What are the elements that make a team effective?\r\n* Is psychological safety the foundation to team performance?\r\n* What can we all do to help foster psychological safety in our teams?\r\n* What is the relationship between safety, stress and engagement?\r\n* What is the profound impact of a lack of safety and engagement on society?\r\n\r\nThis talk has grown as John created the new podcast The Agile Path. The first season on this podcast is about safety in teams. John has interviewed world renowned specialists in the field; Christopher Avery, David Marquet, Jerry Weinberg, Esther Derby, Johanna Rothman, Woody Zuill and many more in over 60 hours of audio. This has been a fascinating deep dive learning experience for John and he hopes to explore these insights with the audience.\r\n\r\n## Learning Outcomes\r\n\r\n* Understand the definition for psychological safety and explore it's meaning.\r\n* Understand what a team really is.\r\n* Understand the five facets of an effective team.\r\n* Understand why psychological safety is foundational to team effectiveness.\r\n* Understand some of the key signs of un-safety in teams.\r\n* Understand the relationship between safety, workplace stress and engagement (using the JD-R model)\r\n* Understand the impact of low safety, low engagement workplaces on wider society.",

During this session, we will use the power of the command line, with some help of Visual Studio Code, to create, develop, build and deploy an application to the cloud. Here is how we are going to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nUsing Git Bash, Angular CLI, .NET CLI, and the Azure CLI, we will build 2 separate apps, connect them, commit them to a code repository and deploy to the cloud.

According to the National Center for Women & Information Technology’s By the Numbers report, in 2017 women made up 57% of the professional workforce but only 26% of the technology industry. In addition, women were twice as likely to leave their job than men in 2016.

This talk can help you avoid all of that.\r\n\r\nThe speaker has created ACRUMEN, a _simple_ Software Quality Framework, based on six short aspects that completely cover the field of software quality.  _Most_ of them are based on well known principles, but most developers seem unaware of the _most important_ one!  Yet the whole framework's basic explanation is so short, it _literally_ fits on the back of a business card -- _without_ small print.\r\n\r\nThis talk introduces ACRUMEN, explains each aspect in turn, gives you _immediately useful tips_ on how to _achieve_ each one (and how to use the framework).  You will come away better equipped to analyze the quality of anybody's software, give precise feedback on its shortcomings, and most importantly, improve the quality of your own code.\r\n\r\nThe aspects and tips are timeless and completely technology-agnostic, useful with languages from the dinosaur days to tomorrow and beyond, and by developers from fresh-faced novices to grizzled graybeards.",

If the room is large, I will need a microphone.\r\n\r\nOr if you mean what technical stuff the audience needs to understand first, not really much.  The more they know about software development the better, but only very basic knowledge is really _required_.  I do reference some concepts that some people might be unfamiliar with, but in each case I either explain it, or don't use it in much detail, so they don't need to _already_ understand it.  I'm hoping that if I reference something they don't already know, and I don't explain it enough to impart a decent understanding, they'll at least remember, \"hmmm, that presenter last week said something called 'whatever' would help with this kind of problem, I forget what he said that was, let me go Google it\".\r\n\r\nWhy I'm the best to speak on this: there are very few people speaking on anything like this.  This is the first attempt I've seen to boil down the entire field of software quality (at least, as far as I see it), _including_ points of view _other_ than the developers, to a small number of briefly definable key aspects, especially with concrete advice for steps we can take to achieve them.\r\n\r\nI've given a 35-40 minute version at DevConf.pl 2018, 20-35 minute versions at Washington DC area Meetups, and five-minute Lightning Talks at other conferences in the USA.  You can see videos of some versions linked from the Resources section of my web site (http://www.Codosaur.us/resources).\r\n\r\nIf desired, I can also stretch it into longer lengths (including up to full-day workshops), by going into more detail and/or adding exercises, but will need lead-time to prepare.",

        "abstract": "In the midst of a $437 billion market for digital transformation, many digital experiences suffer from poor user adoption. Users are experiencing the fidelity gap—space between the static design and full digital experience. Join us to explore filling the fidelity gap with stack-neutral practices.",
        "description": "In 2018 the US market for digital transformation was $437 billion which reflects 16.8% growth year-over-year (Shirer & Smith, 2017). Simultaneously, two-thirds of all business leaders believe that their companies must pick up the pace of digitalization to remain competitive (Moore, 2017). Yet, even with this demand, teams implement solutions that lack of agility. Tangoe’s Murray lays it out: “Developers are coding to specific spec sheets with little conceptual understanding of how this button or feature fits within the overall user experience.”\r\n\r\nThe lack of agility and conceptual understanding of the whole results in a gap—the fidelity gap—where the marriage design and engineering is not as strong as the product creators intended. Symptoms may include a lack of consistency, responsiveness, navigation, and accessibility (Abramov, 2018).\r\n\r\nJoin Simon Yost to explore filling the fidelity gap with stack-neutral concepts and practices that engineering and design teams can work together to champion on any stack.",
        "notes": "Greetings! My name is Simon Yost and I would be honored to present at your event. I'm a native Nebraskan, attended UNL and Millard South High School, and a diehard Husker football fan. St. Louis, Missouri has been home for the last decade. I live in the city with my wife and four kids.\r\n\r\nMy mission is to empower teams to close the gap between design and engineering so that digital experiences connect people. Practically, I'm very hands-on coding in various languages from JavaScript to GoLang. Keeping a hands-on role helps me maximize the potential of multi-disciplinary teams and create sustainable, nimble digital experiences and technical solutions.\r\n\r\nI have spent 15 years building organizations (startups, nonprofits, and enterprise) in the Midwest region by spearheading digital strategy and content delivery. That includes countless hours coaching professionals and students on building applications, creating digital experiences, and installing systems in their businesses. I currently serve as a technology consultant at Slalom St. Louis.\r\n\r\nOutside of work, I am a husband, father, amateur cyclist, and self-professed coffee aficionado.

Redux, with over 1 million `react-redux` weekly downloads, is also becoming a well-loved state management solution for React. With rising popularity comes common design patterns and methods of implementation. However, sometimes these patterns just don't work. With an increasing maturity of React and Redux, patterns that were once able to be implemented at the beginning of their lifetime may no longer be the best or even a viable solution. \r\n\r\nLet's take a look at these antipatterns to understand why they cause issues, how they can be avoided, and what a better solution might look like.\r\n",

        "description": "In most manager/employee relationships, the employee is a resource for the manager. The manager has a goal, something they are responsible for, and the employee is helping them to meet their goal. When it goes well, the manager is also providing feedback and coaching that helps the employee improve and grow their career. When it doesn't go well, the manager's goals trump the needs of the employee, and the employee must sink or swim. Often times, these two dynamics are at odds with each other and can even put the manager in a difficult position.\r\nAt Hudl, we took a different approach. We used a form a matrix management where managers don't typically work on the same team as their reports. We removed the delegating aspect from management, and this led to a completely different dynamic in the manager/report relationship. It actually inverted the relationship where it is now clear that the manager is a resource for the report. Our managers focus their efforts on coaching and growing the skills of their reports. Our successes are seeing our reports meet their goals. \r\nThis dynamic provides an interesting mix of pros and cons. I'll talk through those as well as the logistics of running a product team with this structure. My goal is for anyone in a more traditional org structure to start thinking about the benefits of changing up their structure.",

When do you discuss things like test case construction? Test data creation? Performance needs? And let's just skip by security because that's scary.\r\n\r\nIn this session we'll walk through creating a critical business feature. We'll take the journey all the way from ideation through production monitoring. You'll learn where to have various conversations about quality, and what you might consider along the way.\r\n\r\nYou'll see examples of good conversations used to help business focus on high-value features. You'll also help build out solid acceptance criteria, and you'll learn where to tie those pesky \"Non-functional requirements\" in. We'll tie all this together with working tests and code--and you'll see how exploratory testing fits in along the entire journey.\r\n\r\nMake sure you're getting the best quality coverage of your work!",

        "description": "You are transition to microservices, you have remote teams, you are wanting to update existing services, you are doing all three. The consistent theme in all of these needs is that they require collaboration across teams and concerns. A common problem however with collaboration is that there is often a lot of wait time. Team A needs for team B to implement and deploy a service, update a service, or figure out why a service isn’t working correctly, this can be a very frustrating process and instead of collaborating you feel like you are competing! There is a better way though and that is with contract driven development! \r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will learn about the goals and processes behind contract driven development. Once we have the underlying principles figured out, we will switch to the practical and look at using Spring Cloud Contract to write contracts. Spring Cloud Contract offers several approaches for writing contracts and we will cover them so your organization can choose which would be the best fit.

        "abstract": "Brad Frost's Atomic Design is one of the best user interface design philosophies out there. Its simplistic approach to user interfaces encourages concise, maintainable UI elements. We can easily use Atomic Design when creating our React applications for a better developer and user experience.",
        "description": "Atomic Design is the concept of breaking down user interfaces into smaller, simpler elements. There are five different levels in atomic design: atoms, molecules, organism, templates, and pages. These levels are combined to make user interfaces.\r\n\r\nReact, at its core, follows Atomic Design inherently by encouraging developers to keep components as simple and as broken down as possible. From this simplicity, we can create more complex components and containers of components to create the user interfaces for our applications. Following these patterns gives us, as developers, an easy to manage (and test) ecosystem within our React applications.\r\n\r\nDuring this talk, we'll dive into the roots of Atomic Design and how we can apply these design principles to our React applications.",
        "notes": "I have been working with React for a little over a year and a half. In that time, I have made my fair share of architectural mistakes, seen other peoples' mistakes, and learned from both. One of the greatest lessons I've learned about React is how much it thrives under the KISS (keep it simple stupid) and the \"do one thing and do it well\" (UNIX) methodologies. Implementing Atomic Design patterns when architecting React applications ensures that these methodologies are followed.\r\n\r\nWhen I first heard about Atomic Design three years ago, I didn't really think much of it other than, \"that's an interesting approach\". However, once I ran into more difficulties with how my React applications were architected, I decided to take another look at the design principles behind Atomic Design and it vastly improved my quality of code. I hope to share the relationships that can exist between Atomic Design and React to help other developers with similar struggles. I have already written a Medium article on this topic as well.\r\n\r\nThis talk is designed for all audiences. It can greatly benefit developers new to React as well as seasoned React developers that might need a few tips to avoid some common pitfalls.",

Along the way, I've struggled to build products that real people need and actually want to use. Join me as I share these experiences. **I'll introduce you to Jack** and provide concrete strategies to know your users through shared emotion. Finally, you'll learn how fears can expose needs which clarify what to build and when. ",

        "description": "Most code in the world is legacy code. Legacy projects tend to be lacking in test coverage. Unfortunately, legacy projects are often written in such a way that it makes it difficult to add tests - tests that are badly needed in order to start paying down technical debt and get the project on the right track.\r\n\r\nFortunately there are some effective ways of wrangling legacy code into submission. If we can break apart a legacy project's entanglement of dependencies, making the code more modular and loosely coupled, we can add tests more easily. But breaking apart dependencies is tricky and requires a few certain techniques in order to be done safely.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n- Why legacy projects are harder to test than greenfield projects\r\n- Why adding tests to legacy projects is risky\r\n- How to mitigate the risks of modifying legacy code\r\n- What dependency injection is, why it’s useful in testing legacy projects, and how to use it\r\n- How to break dependencies using Michael Feathers’ “sprout class” technique",

We offer a full-time, 3 month course that aims to take students from any background and teach them the skills necessary to be hirable as a junior developer. \r\n\r\nBeing a programmer in today's ecosystem is so much more than just learning to write code. You have to be a functional member of a team, you need to understand how to communicate around code, sell solutions to non-technical stakeholders, gather and estimate user requirements, implement a testing plan, and deploy code to a production environment. And those are just the skills once you're employed. If you want to get your first job as a programmer, you need to learn how to properly advertise yourself on a resume, curate your personal brand online, how to network at a meetup, how to handle yourself in an interview. The MU Code Academy makes sure you'll walk away with all of the necessary skills needed to break into the industry. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will overview the obstacles we see that new comers to tech are having to overcome and explain how we're meeting those challenges head on to educate the best possible candidates to meet our local tech talent shortage.

Then this talk is for you!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll start by looking into the goal of code reviews and why we should be doing them. From there, I'll show you the common mistakes that teams make with code reviews and how to fix them. To wrap things up, I'll show you what I do when performing code reviews.\r\n\r\nIntended for developers of all levels, attendees will understand the reason why we should have code reviews, signs of bad reviews, signs of good reviews, and have some ideas to take back with them.",

And yet despite the improvement in our tools, we somehow don’t spend time talking about how to maintain our most important tool - the one between our ears. Your mental health is arguably the single most important factor in your ability to perform well, avoid burnout, and build resiliency, but we shroud the topic in secrecy, stigma, and co-opted clinical language that makes us think we know what's going on. We often don't even speak of what we feel to family and friends until we're facing a crisis.\r\n\r\nWe need to change all of that. You don't have to stay in the dark, and you *don't* have to suffer alone. In this talk we’ll start with some basics about mental health, then cover the most common mental health challenges facing developers, and then learn about some techniques to supercharge your brain by improving your mental hygiene (whether you have a psychological disorder or not).

That’s why we created AI and machine learning, right? Because humans can make mistakes, and computers are perfect. Well, there’s some bad news: humans make those AIs and machine learning models, and as a result humanity’s biases and missteps can subtly work their way into our AI and models.\r\n\r\nAll hope isn’t lost, though! In this talk you’ll learn how science and statistics have already solved some of these problems and how a robust awareness of cognitive biases can help with many of the rest.

The premise is simple, a group has 60 minutes to search for clues, put those clues together correctly to solve puzzles, and successfully escape. When Cybersecurity teams respond to an incident, they have a limited amount of time to search through alerts and logs to find clues, put them together correctly to determine the impact, and respond successfully defend to their company from breach. Given the stress of the situation, many teams make mistakes and fail. Applying some simple principles, incident response can be dramatically improved. This interactive presentation will guide participants through the theory behind games such as escape rooms and the proven techniques for solving them. Then we will apply those to Cybersecurity teams through some great stories of incident response success and failures.",

        "description": "**Prologue: Once Upon A Time in Software**\r\n \r\nOnce there was a project that was frustrating, it had lots of bugs and made the team unhappy. For the next project, we tried something new: the QA on the team would learn C# and she would write automated tests before the developers started coding. The team was happy, and the app runs to this day with only bugs caused by bad data the client told us could never exist. \r\n\r\nThe end. Or is it really... The Beginning?\r\n\r\nThis talk is the story of a learning quest, what I've discovered along the way teaching QAs to write test automation in Java, C#, and JavaScript, and my own journey of picking up new languages for fun, like Elixir. It is aimed at QA testers who want to broaden their testing skills, and at developers who want to help them get there. No prior coding knowledge is required for the QAs.",
        "notes": "This topic is something I’ve been driving hard at WWT Asynchrony Labs, and we’ve seen big improvements in our software quality. I want to answer these questions:\r\n\r\n**As a QA, what do you gain from automation?**\r\nComputers are great at performing automated checks to make sure the app does what it's supposed to do, leaving you more time to make sure the app is NOT doing what it's NOT supposed to do. Automation lets you stress and prod an app in new ways, and gives you a view of its internal workings that can guide your testing straight to the vulnerabilities\r\n\r\n**How do you teach people?**\r\nThere's a road-map that I've used over the last four years with QA apprentices, automation boot-camps, and 1:1 teaching. You start simple and small, do it as test-driven development and use pairing. I have battle-tested exercises to share that have helped people learn.\r\n\r\n**Why bother? We have developers for that.**\r\nQA people learning to write test automation gives you benefits far beyond just having those tests. It helps cement team relationships, hugely improves opportunities for drive-by trolling of developers ;), and gives QA more understanding of how the application is put together. That improves knowledge of where the weak points could be, and how to better test. You also get better communication and more cross-role knowledge transfer, which makes better software.\r\n\r\n**Why feedback?**\r\nBecause you learn faster when you get useful, targeted, relevant feedback. I'll briefly go over how to give and receive good feedback for the learning process.\r\n\r\n**Learning outcomes:**\r\n\r\n* QAs will know how automation can make your lives easier as testers\r\n* Why automation gives you more scope to test, and provides leverage to increase your impact\r\n* QAs will have a list of exercises to start exploring how to write tests in any language\r\n* Developers will have a road-map for pairing with QAs to teach effectively (TDD, code reviews, questions to ask)\r\n* People will have a framework for giving and receiving feedback that helps people improve (language specificity, facts not judgments, always be kind)\r\n\r\n**Agenda:**\r\n\r\n* Once Upon A Time in Software\r\n* The Reluctant Hero: But I don't want to be a developer! \r\n* Your quest, should you choose to accept it: (This is how QAs get started)\r\n* One does not simply walk into Mordor: (Taking the first steps)\r\n* Power-ups, dragons, wizards, and gold: (How developers can teach)\r\n* The end-of-level boss battle: (Good feedback and coaching to improve)\r\n* Happily ever after, for everyone",

Getting the people part right is key.First, ask a lot of questions. Use the 70/30 rule -- ask questions 70% of the time and share your stories and ideas 30% of the time. This is your chance to learn about the company, your project and the people that you will be working with, so you want to spend most of your time listening. Be ready with a plan for getting up-to-speed, even if all the parts are not in place when you start. Chances are your accounts and access might not be fully functional from day one, so be ready with things to do in the meantime.
