He is an advocate for talking openly about psychology and mental health in the technical world, and he spends a lot of time thinking about how we program and why we program, and about the tools, structures, cultures, and mental processes that help and hinder us from our ultimate goal of writing amazing things. His hair is brown and his thorax is a shiny blue color.","organization":"Aviture","title":"How to Work with People: A Guide to Playing Nicely with Others","description":"Humans. No matter what we might wish, we have to work with them to get stuff done. Unfortunately, when we join a team it doesn’t come with a manual. Figuring out how to get things done and get everyone pulling in the same direction can be a nightmare.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn’t have to be! In this example-driven talk you’ll learn what a personality type is, you’ll learn some methods for communicating better with others, and you’ll dip a toe into the psychology of team dynamics - all without having to read a huge textbook or a bunch of manager-focused books trying to sell you something. You’ll come away with tools you can use to be a better teammate and to create a stronger team, regardless of your role. Let’s get started actually working together!","photo":"/photos/arthurDoler.jpg"},"nextId":"john-henry-muller","previousId":"cameron-presley"}}
