Avoiding missteps and false starts in your new job","description":"Congratulations on your new job... now what! Starting a new job, especially if it’s your first one, is always exciting... and stressful. Here’s how to take control of the situation and make sure that you’re ready to start strong from day one. As superficial as it sounds, you want to look your best when you are meeting so many people for the first time. But you should dress appropriately for your environment - a suit would be out of place in most technical organizations. The what not to wear part is easy… but what should you wear? Getting the people part right is key.First, ask a lot of questions. Use the 70/30 rule -- ask questions 70% of the time and share your stories and ideas 30% of the time. This is your chance to learn about the company, your project and the people that you will be working with, so you want to spend most of your time listening. Be ready with a plan for getting up-to-speed, even if all the parts are not in place when you start. Chances are your accounts and access might not be fully functional from day one, so be ready with things to do in the meantime. You’ll leave with a checklist of things to do so you walk in the door on day one ready to go.","organization":"Women Who Code, Atlanta","photo":"/photos/bethLaing.jpg"},"nextId":"cameron-presley","previousId":"ash-banaszek"}}
