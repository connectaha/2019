Interested in the cultures and tools that enable high-performing teams and organizations.","title":"Build your Brand (or someone else will do it for you)","description":"For this presentation I will share some proven strategies that empower software makers. Branding seems to be a real blind spot for many software engineers. As an engineer myself, I know that often we focus on a solution when the problem is not yet clear. The problem, or opportunity, is to develop and maintain a satisfying career in the future of software. As you face failure and success over and over again, how you react is a big part of your personal brand. The areas you focus on and projects you attach yourself to are also a part of that brand. Don't let someone else be your puppet master, pull your own strings.","organization":"Wallaby Consulting","photo":"/photos/placeholder.jpg"},"nextId":"greg-dick","previousId":"courtney-heitman"}}
