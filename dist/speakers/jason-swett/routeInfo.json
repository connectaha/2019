Legacy projects tend to be lacking in test coverage. Unfortunately, legacy projects are often written in such a way that it makes it difficult to add tests - tests that are badly needed in order to start paying down technical debt and get the project on the right track.\r\n\r\nFortunately there are some effective ways of wrangling legacy code into submission. If we can break apart a legacy project's entanglement of dependencies, making the code more modular and loosely coupled, we can add tests more easily. But breaking apart dependencies is tricky and requires a few certain techniques in order to be done safely.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n- Why legacy projects are harder to test than greenfield projects\r\n\r\n- Why adding tests to legacy projects is risky\r\n\r\n- How to mitigate the risks of modifying legacy code\r\n\r\n- What dependency injection is, why it’s useful in testing legacy projects, and how to use it\r\n\r\n- How to break dependencies using Michael Feathers’ “sprout class” technique","organization":"","photo":"/photos/jasonSwett.jpg"},"nextId":"javier-lozano","previousId":"greg-dick"}}
