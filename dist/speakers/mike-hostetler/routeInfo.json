He started in networking and Unix administration, and grew into technical support and QA testing. But he has always done some development on the side and decided a few years ago to pursue it full-time. His history of working with users gives Mike a unique perspective on writing software.","title":"Python for the Curious","description":"Python is used in many applications today and yet some people seem mystified by it. Maybe it's the whitespace, maybe it's dynamic typing, maybe it's because it seems... too clean looking. Yet Python is useful for one-off scripts and for full-blown web applications (just ask Instagram or Pinterest). And Python is becoming the de facto language in many data science applications. We will touch on all this, show some examples, and make fun of \"enterprise\" languages as we look at a simple, yet powerful, language.","organization":"Object Partners, Inc","photo":"/photos/mikeHostetler.jpg"},"nextId":"nicholas-tuck","previousId":"mike-douglas"}}
