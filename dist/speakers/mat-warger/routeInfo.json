There are enough libraries and enough churn to make anyone feel lost in the shuffle. Common concerns for any modern web application include features like authentication, user content, APIs, and analytics. In this session, you will get a break-down and demo of the key features of AWS Amplify, an open-source toolchain from Amazon. Amplify abstracts away the common functionality that so many applications share and allows developers to focus on building â€“ not plumbing! This session will walk through a simple application high-lighting the features and tools the library provides. This should leave you with the knowledge of \"how and why\" you would integrate this with your own projects. The session will use React to demonstrate the features of the library, but general front-end development experience is all that is required.","photo":"/photos/matWarger.jpg"},"nextId":"matt-busche","previousId":"katia-wheeler"}}
