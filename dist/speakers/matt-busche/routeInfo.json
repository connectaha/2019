Secure-by-design is a guiding principle for building software. By tackling security issues when designing an application security is no longer an afterthought after the project has been completed. We'll learn how good design drives security by using patterns, mindsets, and best practices for real world development. We'll also discuss how to find and address flaws in existing code and most importantly we'll discuss how good design encourages security by using domain primitives, the builder pattern, error handling, and validation.  Finally we'll discuss tools that can help prevent these flaws from making it into your code repository, these can be ran on your local machine or as a hook in your continuous integration process.","photo":"/photos/placeholder.jpg"},"nextId":"michael-eaton","previousId":"mat-warger"}}
