","title":"Becoming a Social Developer: A Guide for Introverts","description":"This is NOT a highly-interactive workshop. Now that you feel a bit safer, make the most of your time here: talk to other developers. This is easy -- and incredibly terrifying. A few simple steps (and a bit of bravery) is all that it takes to get started. Building your developer network will boost your knowledge, your skills, and your career. Can an introvert become a social developer? YES! And we can do this while staying true to ourselves.","organization":"","photo":"/photos/jeremyClark.jpg"},"nextId":"jerry-koske","previousId":"jeff-strauss"}}
